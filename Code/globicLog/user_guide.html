 <h1 style="color:#1E90FF">Globic Log Service - User Guide</h1>

 <p>The aim of this guide is to provide users of the Globic Log Service with all the necessary information 
    in order to utilise the service.<br />
	Requests made to the The Globic Log Service are through a URI and http method. An effective means to 
	make these requests is through the use of a http transfer library (such as Curl).<br /><br />
	The three main functional points of the Service are:<br/>
	<a href="#register_heading">Registration</a><br />
	<a href="#prov_gen_heading">Provenance Generation</a><br />
	<a href="#data_retrieval_heading">Data Retrieval</a>
	</p>

 <h2 style="color:#FF0000"><a id="register_heading">1- Registration</a></h2>
  
 <p>This section describes how to register a component with the Globic Log Service. A component must 
    register with the service before it can avail of the provenance generation or data retrieval services.<br/>
	Registration with the system is carried out via a URI request and uses the <b>POST</b> method. 
	The structure of the request is important for the service to recognise what needs to be carried out. 
	The structure is as follows:
	<ul>
	<li><b>POST http://www.example.com/globicLog/register/?componentName=(...)&password=(...)&graphName=(...)</b></li>
	</ul>
	Three tokens are used in the request to specify the information to submit.
	<ul>
	<li><b>?componentName </b> : Here you specify what name you want to call your component. Component name 
	    must be unique. It is not possible to have two or more components with the same name registered
		with the service.</li>
		<br />
	<li><b>&password </b> : Here you specify your password which will be used to verify your component 
	    when making requests to the system. It is recommended not use a password you have for any other 
		accounts.</li>
		<br />
	<li><b>&partitionName </b> (optional) : Here you can specify a partition in the triple-store in which 
	    your component will store data to and retrieve data from. This is an optional token in the request.
		If it is not specified, you will record data to and retrieve data from a default partition in the
		triple-store. This option can be useful if you want your own 'sandbox' so provenance records from 
		other components will not be appear in your partition. It is also possible for multiple 
		components to specify the partition name if they wish to share the same provenance data.</li>
	</ul>
	Each of the three token data fields are restricted to using numbers (0-9), letters (A-Z a-z), 
	the dash symbol ( - ) and the underscore symbol ( _ ).If any part of the request is wrong, the 
	service will return an error message indicating where the error possibly lies. A message confirming 
	registration will be returned if there are no error in the request.<br /><br />
	As an example of the registration process, a component by the name of 'MockComponent_1' will register 
	with the service:
	<ul>
	<li>POST http://www.example.com/globicLog/register/?componentName=MockComponent_1&password=123456&partitionName=partition1</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<hr />
 
 <h2 style="color:#FF0000"><a id="prov_gen_heading">2 - Provenance Generation</a></h2>
 <p>This section describes how to submit data to the service in order for it to generate provenance 
    data in RDF making special use of the <a href="http://www.cngl.ie/ontologies/gic#">
	Globic semantic model</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#">PROV-O semantic model</a>. 
	A component must be registered with the service before it can submit data. Submitting data to the 
	service is done in a similar manner to registration, through a URI request and use of the <b>POST</b> 
	method. Like the registration request, the structure of the provenance generation request is 
	important for the service to recognise what needs to be carried out. The structure is as follows:
	<ul>
	<li><b>POST http://www.example.com/globicLog/service/(your_component_name)/?password=(...)&activity=(...)&user=(...)&contentConsumed1=(...)&contentConsumed1Type=(...)&contentGenerated1=(...)&contentGenerated1Type=(...)</b></li>
	</ul>
	There are a number of tokens associated with the provenance generation request, some are mandatory 
	and some optional. Notice how a components name appears in the request, it is not specified as a token.
	<ul>
	<li><b>?password</b> : Here you enter your password.</li>
	<br />
	<li><b>&activity</b> : Here you enter the activity that is being carried out by your component.
	    An activity is limited to the list of content processing activities specified in the Globic 
		semantic model. In order for the service to be able to recognise the activity, the name you give 
		to the activity being carried out must contain the <u>actual name of the activity</u> as specified in the 
		Globic model.<br /> 
		For example, two content processing activities within the Globic model are <i>TextAnalysis</i> 
		and <i>Translate</i>. Some Sample activity names that would work with the service would be : 
		textanalysis_50, 5_My_TextAnalysis, translateActivity101 or my_translate_92. These work as the 
		<u>actual activity name</u> appears within the name given. Some Sample activity names that would 
		not work with the service would be: 5_My_Text_Analysis, AnalysisText_12 or trans_7.<br />
		A list of the content processing activities from the Globic semantic model and the types of 
		content that an activity can consume or generate can be found <a href="http://localhost/globicLog/activity_content_list.html">here</a>.</li>
		<br />
	<li><b>&user</b> (Optional) : Here you can specify if a user was involved in an activity along with 
	    a component. This is an optional token in the request as a user does not always have to be 
		involved in an activity. The user can be the name of a person or a worker ID number etc. 
		If specifying the user as the name of a person with a first and last name, do not use a space 
		between the names, instead use humpback notation or use an underscore, for example: JoeBloggs or 
		Joe_Bloggs.</li>
	<br />
	<li><b>&contentConsumed#</b> (Optional *) : Here it is possible to specify up to 10 pieces of content 
        that were consumed or used by an activity. This is an optional token in the request as not all 
		activities consume content. Pieces of content consumed are specified by appending a number (1-10) 
		at the end of the token, where the hash symbol is located. The Globic Log Service deals with 
		content from a file oriented perspective, so what you specify is a URI of the files location.<br />
		An example to specify two pieces of consumed content, <i>document_1</i> and 
		<i>document_2</i> with a URI location of <i>http://www.example.com/filestore/</i>, 
		would look as follows: &contentConsumed1=&lthttp://www.example.com/filestore/document_1&gt&contentConsumed2=&lthttp://www.example.com/filestore/docuemnt_2&gt .<br />
		</li>
	<br />
	<li><b>&contentConsumed#Type</b> (Optional) : Here it is possible to specify the <i>type</i> of any of 
	    the consumed content. The <i>type</i> describes what a piece of content is i.e. 
		a string, a word, a sentence, a structure, a translation, a revise translation, 
		a piece of analyised text etc. The Globic semantic model contains the types of content that can be
		consumed for each activity so when specifying a type for a piece of consumed content, 
		it must match that in the Globic model.This is an optional token in the request; it is used to 
		make the generated provenance data more accurate. If it is not set then any consumed content 
		is set to a default type. In order to specify a type for a piece of consumed content, the number 
		associated with a piece of consumed content is placed in the token, where the hash symbol is 
		located.<br />
		For example, if you have already specified some consumed content: &contentConsumed1=<http://www.example.com/filestore/document_1> .
        In order to declare that document_1 is of type <i>nif:String</i>, you would add the following to 
		the request: &contentConsumed1Type=nif:String .<br />
        The content types must use the appropriate namespaces. A list of the content processing activities
		from the Globic semantic model and the types of content that an activity can consume or generate
        can be found <a href="http://localhost/globicLog/activity_content_list.html">here<a/>.</li>
	<br />
	<li><b>&contentGenerated#</b> (Optional *) : Here it is possible to specify up to 10 pieces of content 
        that were generated by an activity. This is an optional token in the request as not all 
		activities generate content. Pieces of content are specified by appending a number (1-10) at the 
		end of the token, where the hash symbol is located. The Globic Log Service deals with content 
		from a file oriented perspective, so what you specify is a URI of the files location.<br />
		An example to specify two pieces of content that were generated, <i>document_3</i> and 
		<i>document_4</i> with a URI location of <i>http://www.example.com/filestore/</i>, 
		would look as follows: &contentGenerated1=&lthttp://www.example.com/filestore/document_3&gt&contentGenerated2=&lthttp://www.example.com/filestore/docuemnt_4&gt .</li>
	<br />
	<li><b>&contentGenerated#Type</b> (Optional) : Here it is possible to specify the <i>type</i> of any of 
	    the generated content similar to how you can do it for any content consumed. The Globic semantic 
		model contains the types of content that can be generated for each activity so when specifying 
		a type for a piece of generated content, it must match that in the Globic model. This is an 
		optional token in the request; it is used to make the generated provenance data more accurate. 
		If it is not set then any consumed content is set to a default type. In order to specify a type 
		for a piece of generated content, the number associated with a piece of generated content is 
		placed in the token, where the hash symbol is located.<br />
		For example, if you have already specified some generated content: &contentGenereated1=&lthttp://www.example.com/filestore/document_3&gt .
        In order to declare that document_3 is of type <i>gic:Translation</i>, you would add the following 
		to the request: &contentGenerated1Type=gic:Translation .<br />
		The content types must use the appropriate namespaces. A list of the content processing activities
		from the Globic semantic model and the types of content that an activity can consume or generate
        can be found <a href="http://localhost/globicLog/activity_content_list.html">here<a/>.</li>
	</ul>
	(<b>Optional *</b> = While the '&contentConsumed#' and '&contentGenerated#' tokens are optional 
	 themselves, at least one must appear in a request as an activity must consume or generate at least 
	 one piece of content.)<br/><br/>

 <h2 style="color:#FF0000"><a id="data_retrieval_heading">3 - Provenance Data Retrieval</a></h2>
 <p>This section describes how to retrieve provenance data from the service about a piece of <i>content</i>, 
    a <i>component</i>, an <i>activity</i> or a <i>user</i>. The data is returned in JSON format.
	A component must be registered with the service before it can retrieve data. Retrieving data from 
	the service is carried out via a URI request and uses the <b>GET</b> method. The structure of the data 
	retrieval request is important for the service to recognise what needs to be carried out. 
	The structure is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
	<li><b>GET http://www.example.com/globicLog/service/(your_component_name)/?password=(...)&retrieveData=(...)</b></li>
	</ul>
	There are two tokens associated with the data retrieval request, both are mandatory. 
	Notice how a components name appears in the the request, it is not specified as a token.
	<ul>
	<li><b>?password</b> : Here you enter your password.</li>
	<br />
	<li><b>&requestData</b> : Here it is possible to specify the name of some data for which you wish to 
	retrieve provenance records about. It is possible to retrieve provenance records about a piece of 
	<i>content</i>, a <i>component</i>, an <i>activity</i> or a <i>user</i>. For example:<br />
	To retrieve provenance records about a piece content, you would add the following to the request:
	&retrieveData=&lthttp://www.example.com/filestore/document_1&gt.<br/>
    To retrieve provenance records about a component, an activity or a user, you would add the following
    to the request: <br/>
	<b>Component:</b> &retrieveData=gic:MockComponent_1 <br/>
	<b>Activity:</b> &retrieveData=gic:translateActivity101 <br/>
	<b>User:</b> &retrieveData=gic:Joe_Bloggs<br/><br/>
	Note the difference between retrieving provenance records about a piece of content and a component, 
	activity or a user. Content is always declared as a URI and a component, activity or a user always use
	the <b>gic:</b> namespace.<br/>
	</li>
	</ul>
	Examples of retrieved provenance data can be found <a href="http://localhost/globicLog/example_provenance.html">here</a>.
