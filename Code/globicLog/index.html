 <h2 style="color:#FF0000">Description of Service</h2>
 
 <p>The Globic Log Service provides a means for CNGL components to generate, store and retrieve provenance 
    data about their activities and content. This generated provenance data is in RDF format and is 
	particularly concerned with the <a href="http://www.cngl.ie/ontologies/gic#">Globic</a> 
	and <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#">PROV-O</a> semantic models.Requests to the service are via a 
	URI request with a HTTP method. A component must register with the service before it can utilise any 
	functionality of the service. The service has been designed so the user does not have to write an RDF 
	triple or create a SPARQL query.</p>
 
 <p>A user guide of how to utilise the service is provided through the link below:</p>
